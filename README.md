## Overview
### Description
Inspired by my siblings weekly "adventures", this app will provide the user with an all in one location to find interesting landmarks around their area! One of the many pleasures in life is exploring nature, watching the sunset at the beach, going on sceanic drives, and many more. This App aims to provide an easy to use road map to plan out and share their own adventures! Using the devices location, the app will filter areas of interest nearby and provide recommendations to the user using a map and filter feature. Each location could be given a rating by the user and they could include photos of the visited spot, the review alongside with the pictures could be seen by other users when they're also . In addition to the recommendations, the user will be able to plan out a "road trip" will consist of an adventure with multiple points of interests that they could construct and share with others! The app will also provide a "badge" system which will provide the users with badges they they could show off on their user profiles once a certain challenge is complete. Adventure More will be the perfect travel companion!

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Web Mapping
- **Mobile:** This app differs from a glorified website, or using google maps, by having the app do the searching for the user. It provides an easy to use interface so that the map could filter to the users desires and pin point locations near them using the filters. The app is so that the user, doesn't have to use a search engine looking for places to visit. 
- **Story:** The value of this app is to provide the user with suggestions on places to discover around their area. This will consist of scenic views, hiking trails, landmarks, beaches, etc. The user will be able to create "Road trips" which will let them string up multiple locations a create a road trip that could be shared with others. 
- **Market:** Adventure More will target users who like to explore the area around them and find new places they haven't been to before. Overall, the app will appeal to the general public.
- **Habit:** The app will contain a Badge system that the user will be able to obtain by completing a series of challenges. For example, a challenge could be to visit 5 beachs on the same day. These badges will be displayed on the users profile and other users will be able to view other users badges. There will eventually be a point system implemented which could be used to purchase things in the app, but this will be part of a later version.
