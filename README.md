## Overview
### Description
Inspired by my siblings weekly "adventures", this app will provide the user with an all in one location to find interesting landmarks around their area! One of the many pleasures in life is exploring nature, going to a new bar, going on sceanic drives, and many more. This App aims to provide an easy to use road map to plan out and share their own adventures! Using the devices location, the app will filter areas of interest nearby and provide recommendations to the user using a map and filter feature. Each location could be given a rating by the user and they could include photos of the visited spot, the review alongside with the pictures could be seen by other users when they're also . In addition to the recommendations, the user will be able to plan out a "road trip" will consist of an adventure with multiple points of interests that they could construct and share with others! The app will also provide a "badge" system which will provide the users with badges they they could show off on their user profiles once a certain challenge is complete.
